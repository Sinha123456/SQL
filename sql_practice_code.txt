1- List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

Select x.continent, x.name
From world x
Where x.name <= ALL (select y.name from world y where x.continent=y.continent)
ORDER BY continent

2- Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population. 

SELECT name, continent, population 
FROM world x 
WHERE 25000000 > ALL(SELECT population 
                     FROM world y 
                     WHERE y.continent = x.continent 
                     )

3- Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

SELECT x.name, x.continent FROM world x
WHERE population > ALL(SELECT y.population*3 FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND y.name != x.name)

Another solution of same question is: 

SELECT x.name, x.continent
  FROM world x
  WHERE x.population >ALL(SELECT population*3
                            FROM world y
                            WHERE y.continent = x.continent
                            AND x.name<>y.name)

Nobel winner queries.

4- Show all details (yr, subject, winner) of the Literature prize winners for 1980 to 1989 inclusive.

SELECT * FROM nobel
WHERE subject = 'Literature' AND yr > 1979 AND yr <= 1989
ORDER BY yr desc

Show all details of the presidential winners:

    Theodore Roosevelt
    Woodrow Wilson
    Jimmy Carter
    Barack Obama

SELECT * FROM nobel
 WHERE subject = 'Peace'
  AND winner IN ('Theodore Roosevelt',
                  'Woodrow Wilson',
                  'Jimmy Carter', 'Barack Obama' )

5- Show the year, subject, and name of Physics winners for 1980 together with the Chemistry winners for 1984.

SELECT yr, subject, winner FROM nobel
WHERE (subject='Physics' AND yr=1980) OR (subject='Chemistry' AND yr = 1984)

6- Show the year, subject, and name of winners for 1980 excluding Chemistry and Medicine

SELECT * FROM nobel
WHERE yr = 1980
 AND subject NOT IN ('Chemistry', 'Medicine')

7- Show year, subject, and name of people who won a 'Medicine' prize in an early year (before 1910, not including 1910) together with winners of a 'Literature' prize in a later year (after 2004, including 2004) 

SELECT * FROM nobel
  WHERE (yr<1910 AND subject = 'Medicine') 
OR
 (yr>=2004 AND     subject='Literature')

8- Find all details of the prize won by EUGENE O'NEILL 

SELECT * FROM nobel
WHERE winner = 'Eugene O''Neill'

9- List the winners, year and subject where the winner starts with Sir. Show the the most recent first, then by name order.

SELECT winner, yr, subject FROM nobel
WHERE winner like 'Sir%'
ORDER BY yr DESC, winner;

Boolean value:
SELECT winner, subject, subject IN ('Physics','Chemistry')---that is boolean(Physics and chemistry are 1 and rest of the subjects are 0)
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr=1984

Note: subject IN ('Physics','Chemistry')---that is boolean(Physics and chemistry are 1 and rest of the subjects are 0)

10- The expression subject IN ('Chemistry','Physics') can be used as a value - it will be 0 or 1.

Show the 1984 winners and subject ordered by subject and winner name; but list Chemistry and Physics last.

SELECT winner, subject
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr=1984
 ORDER BY subject IN('Physics','Chemistry'), subject, winner

Same answer with case statement:

SELECT winner, subject
  FROM nobel
 WHERE yr=1984
 ORDER BY 
CASE WHEN subject IN('Physics','Chemistry') THEN 1
ELSE 0 END,
subject, winner

List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million. 

SELECT continent FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population) >= 100000000
