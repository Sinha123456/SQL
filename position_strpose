1- Use the accounts table to create first and last name columns that hold the first and last names for the primary_poc.

SELECT primary_poc,
STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ') as strposition,
POSITION(' ' IN primary_poc) AS position,
LENGTH(primary_poc),
LEFT(primary_poc, STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')) as first_name,
RIGHT(primary_poc, (LENGTH(primary_poc) - POSITION(' ' IN primary_poc))) AS last_name
FROM accounts

2- Now see if you can do the same thing for every rep name in the sales_reps table. Again provide first and last name columns.

SELECT
LEFT(name, POSITION(' ' IN name)) as f_name,
RIGHT(name, (LENGTH(name) - POSITION(' ' IN name))) as l_name
FROM sales_reps
